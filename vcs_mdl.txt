; macro definition language
; =========================
;
; inputs
; ======
;
; input definitions are distinguised with a leading ">"
;
; arguments are declared ordinally. ie. the first type declaration refers to argument {1}
; 
; . each macro argument is named between braces. eg. {reset address}
;		. note that arguments cannot be referenced by name, only by number. eg {1}
; . the argument type is specified in square brackets. eg. [R]
;	. allowed values (of the argument type) are defined in parenthesis. eg (1..159)
;
; the argument types are as follows (more in the following section)
;	. R -> VCS register
;	. RR -> TIA read register
;	. RW -> TIA write register
; . V -> immediate value
; . A -> absolute address
; . AW -> absolute address (which is in RAM)
;	. VA -> immediate value OR an absolute address
; . Bool -> Boolean value 
;
; allowed values are defined as follows
;	. as a single value (of the type)
; . as a list of discreet values, separated by commas. eg (1,2,3,4)
; . as a range - two values separated by two periods. eg (1..159)
;
;
; inputs (presets)
; =======
; 
; preset requirements are also distinguised with a leading ">"
;
; . CPU register presets are descriptive
;		. A = description
;		. X = description
;		. Y = description
;
;
; input types
; ===========
;
;	R -> VCS register
;	RR -> TIA read register
;	RW -> TIA write register
; RT -> RIOT register
;				. values SHOULD be limited to addresses defined in vcs.h
;				. further limits will be defined by the name of the argument or in free-form comments
;
; V -> immediate value
;				. values can be DASM expressions
;				. values can include a leading # or not
;
; A -> absolute address
;				. values SHOULD be in the cartridge's memory space or console's RAM
;				. ie not in the console's ROM space

; AW -> absolute address
;				. values MUST be in the console's RAM space
;
;	VA -> immediate value OR an absolute address
;				. immediate values MUST include the leading #
;				. rules for A type apply for values that don't include the leading #
;
;
; other requirements
; ==================
; 
; other requirements are distinguished by a leading ! and are descriptive
;
; 
; side effects
; ============
;
; side effects are listed on a single line, distinguished by a leading +
;
; . affected registers/flags denoted by:
;		. A = Accumulator
;		. X = X register
;		. Y = Y register
;		. C = Carry flag
;		. Z = Zero flag
;		. V = Overflow flag
;		. N = Negative flag
;
;
; outputs
; =======
;
; outputs are distinguished by a leading <
; 
; . valid output locations are CPU registers (A, X or Y) or AW arguments (by name)
; . output defintions are descriptive. for example, for a division routine, an output
;		might be: A = remainder
; . S = <value> indicates the value that the status flags reflect
;	. there can be side effects without an output. outputs are side effects that are useful
;
;
; other notes
; ===========
;
; other macro definition notes are distinguished by a leading *
