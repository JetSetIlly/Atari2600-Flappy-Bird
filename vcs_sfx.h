; these macros require a table of values labelled SFX_TABLE
; SFX_TABLE byte pattern:
;
;    queue instruction  -> FF == no queue (sound off)
;                          00 == jump SFX_ENTRY_LEN
;
;    frames            -> 1 to 255 (0 will result in odd behavior)
;
;    noise/tone         -> 00 to FF  (see noise/tone table below)
;                      -> high nibble is channel 1
;                      -> low nibble is channel 0
;
;    frequency 0        -> 00 to 31
;
;    frequency 1        -> 00 to 31
;
;    volume            -> 00 to FF
;                      -> high nibble is channel 1
;                      -> low nibble is channel 0
;
; the first sequence must be the off or idle state for the sfx engine
; for example:
;
;    SFX_TABLE FF 00 00 00 00 00

; noise/tone values (info taken from Paul Slocum's "Atari 2600 Music And Sound Programming Guide" v1.02)

; #    Name    Description
; =======================
; 01  Saw     sounds similar to a saw waveform
; 03  Engine  many 2600 games use this for an engine sound
; 04  Square  a high pitched square waveform
; 06  Bass    fat bass sound
; 07  Pitfall log sound in pitfall, low and buzzy
; 08  Noise   white noise
; 0C  Lead    lower pitch square wave sound
; 0F  Buzz    atonal buzz, good for percussion

; the macros also require the following:
